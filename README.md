# ZingingaTech

ZingiraTech is an innovative platform designed to address Kenya's growing e-waste management crisis. By connecting users of electronic waste (e-waste) with certified recycling companies, ZingiraTech  aims to foster responsible disposal, enhance recycling efforts, and create a sustainable, healthy environment for future generations.

## Problem Statement

Kenya generates approximately 51,300 metric tonnes of e-waste annually, but only 5% is safely recycled. The rest is improperly disposed of, causing:

- Soil and water contamination from toxic substances like lead and mercury.
- Air pollution due to unsafe burning practices.
- Missed opportunities to recover valuable materials.
- Worsening health risks, as many hazardous materials are human carcinogens.

Contributing factors include a lack of organized collection systems, limited public awareness, and the importation of short-lifespan electronic devices.

## Features

1. User-Friendly Platform
Platform: Accessible to households, businesses, and institutions.
Geo-Location: The user chooses their location
Pick-Up Scheduling: Simplify e-waste disposal with easy pick-up scheduling options.
Educational Resources: Provide tips on safe e-waste disposal and recycling benefits.

2. Certified Recycling Network
Database of Certified Partners: Ensure safe recycling by connecting users to vetted companies.
Transparency: Track the lifecycle of e-waste from collection to recycling and material recovery.

3. Incentives
Rewards for Participation: Offer redeemable points for discounts on new electronics or utility bills.

4. Data and Analytics
Impact Reporting: Monitor the environmental and economic benefits of recycling efforts.
Policy Support: Provide data to help shape better e-waste management regulations.

## Project Impact Goals

Environmental Protection: Reduce pollution by ensuring safe disposal of hazardous e-waste materials.
